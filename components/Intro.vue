        <p>If you ever played music with friends, jammed out with colleagues or tried to impress that girl/boy/genderneutralbeing you like, you probably had this problem: You ran out of ideas.<br/>
        Trying to remember a song you once learned is not always easy, especially if you are an old chunk of coal that knows hundreds of songs.<br/>
        That's what Tabulous is for.<br/>
        Collect tabs, chords and lyrics for your favorite songs in one place that coincidentally is also fresh to death and fun to use.
